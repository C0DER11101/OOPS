A constructor with default arguments can be called with or without an argument.....

if it's called with an argument then the constructor with default argument is called....

otherwise it becomes a default constructor!!

If your program has both a default constructor and a constructor with default argument

then a statement like this

A a;
will be an ambigious call because you didn't give any argument, the compiler will get confused whether to use the constructor
with default arguments or the default constructor, so it throws an error!!!!
